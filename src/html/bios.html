        <h1>Band Member Biographies</h1>
          <h3> Harvey Dale </h3>
            <p> Harvey founded Harvey Dale and the Cements four years ago and is the lead singer. He's incredibly proud of it and reminds his fellow bandmembers of it often. Though they often respond by saying "at least we don't still live with our mom," he knows deep down, they appreciate the incessant reminders. </p>
        <h3> Noah Centimeter </h3>
            <p> Noah Centimeter is a drummer, painter and all around good guy. He dyes his hair every other week and yeah it's a little fried from all the bleach but he has an image to maintain. </p>
        <h3> Jesse Williams </h3>
            <p> Jesse Williams is a bassist and thinks Harvey's constant reminders are a little annoying, as are most things about the band. He's studying music at UT-Austin and after he graduates next year, he'll be leaving Harvey Dale and the Cements in the dust.</p>
